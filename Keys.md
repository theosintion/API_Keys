>The HaveIBeenPwned API key is $3.50 per month. With this key, you can use Recon-ng or Spiderfoot to pull from HIBP. Alternatively, you can write your own tool.

## Google

>Google requires 2 API keys, the regular API and the Custom Search Engine (CSE). The API requires a Google account and is accessible here: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard. Once you have an API key, navigate to https://cse.google.com/cse/all for a CSE key.

## Twitter
>For Twitter, we want to use the search API. Although I have never used it, there may be value in using the Engagement API.
